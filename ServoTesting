#Testing out SG90 Servo on GPIO pins on the vision bonnet
#To use the code:
#	Hardware setup
#		pin d connectted to signal of Servo
#		GND pin connected to negative of 5.2v source
#		Servo driver: straight to 5.2v source	
#	Software setup
#		copy this .py file to Desktop directory of rasbperry pi with vision hat, after following kit 
#		tutorial exactly - down to disabling joy detector
#		open pi terminal 
#		cd into Desktop directory
#		type "python3 <filename.py>" into terminal and press enter
