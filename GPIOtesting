#Testing out the GPIO pins on the vision bonnet
#To use the code:
#	Hardware setup
#		pin d connectted to 0.464 kohm resister and base of 2n222p transister
#		GND pin connected to negative of 9v battery
#		LED driver: GND to 0.977 kohm resister to collector-emitter to LED to 9V+		
#	Software setup
#		copy this .py file to Desktop directory of rasbperry pi with vision hat, after following kit 
#		tutorial exactly - down to disabling joy detector
#		open pi terminal 
#		cd into Desktop directory
#		type "python3 <filename.py>" into terminal and press enter
